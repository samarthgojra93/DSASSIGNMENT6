# DSASSIGNMENT6
A collection of data structure implementations and problem solutions written in C/C++. This repository explores core computer science concepts including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and sorting/searching algorithms. Each program focuses on understanding the underlying logic, efficient coding practices and clean implemntation
